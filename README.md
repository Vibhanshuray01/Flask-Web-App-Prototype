**FastAPI-based Data Preprocessing and Augmentation Application**
This project is a FastAPI-based web application designed to preprocess and augment text and image data files. The app provides a user-friendly interface to upload files, apply transformations, and view the results in real time. It is ideal for exploring preprocessing and augmentation techniques to prepare datasets for machine learning and other data-centric projects.

Features
Text Processing
Preprocessing:

Remove special characters.
Standardize text for consistency.
Augmentation:

Synonym replacement to create variation in text data.
Random insertion of filler words.
Image Processing
Preprocessing:

Resize and normalize images.
Adjust brightness for better visibility.
Augmentation:

Rotate images by random angles.
Adjust brightness and convert images to grayscale.
Tech Stack
FastAPI: A modern Python web framework for building APIs.
Python: Backend logic for data preprocessing and augmentation.
Pillow: Library for image processing.
JavaScript: For frontend interactions, file uploads, and result display.
